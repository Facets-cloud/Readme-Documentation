Facets provide a way to dynamically manage system functionality that allows for better control and efficiency.

**Note:** Facets recommends disabling all the resources at the Blueprint level. You can enable the resources only in the specific environments where they are needed, optimizing resource usage and cost efficiency.

## How to Enable or Disable Resources Individually?

1. Select the desired Blueprint from **Blueprint > Lists** and navigate to **Environment > Resource Center.**
2. Open the **Resource Details** page by selecting the resource.
3. Click **Enable**/**Disable** from the top right corner. 
4. In the popup that appears,  type the **Resource Name** in the text box and click **Enable**/**Disable.**

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "450px",
      "border": true,

    }

}

## How to Enable or Disable Resources in Bulk?

Particularly when dealing with a large number of resources, enabling or disabling them individually can be time-consuming and inefficient. The ability to enable or disable resources in bulk streamlines this process. The following steps will guide you on how to achieve this:

1. Select the desired Blueprint from **Blueprint > Lists** and navigate to **Environment > Resource Center.**
2. Select the resources you wish to enable or disable and click the **Enable**/**Disable** button at the bottom.
3. In the pop-up that appears, type **Confirm** and click **Enable**/**Disable.**

**Note:** The bulk enable or disable feature allows for mass enabling or disabling of resources; however, it's important to remember that only one action type can be selected at a time - either enabling disabled resources or disabling enabled ones. Random selection of resources for mixed actions is not supported.
