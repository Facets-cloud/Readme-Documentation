For a better understanding of the concept of Blueprint and associated functionality, we recommend going through the [Blueprint](https://readme.facets.cloud/docs/blueprint) concepts documentation.

## How to create your first Blueprint?

1. Navigate to **Blueprints > List,** and click **New Blueprint.**
2. Begin by assigning a unique **Name** to your Blueprint. 
3. Proceed to the **Repository Setup.\
   Create a new Repository** will be selected by default. 
4. Choose your VCS Account from the available list. To create a new VCS account, click on **Create New Account,** provide the necessary details, and then select the account. For more details, refer to the [Integrate Version Control Systems (VCS) with Facets](https://readme.facets.cloud/docs/integrating-vcs-accounts) documentation.
5. Specify the master **Branch Name** (for example, "main" for GitHub or "master" for Bitbucket).
6. Select your **Primary Cloud** provider and begin with the default JSON for resources. If necessary, you can later modify it to suit a different provider. For more details, refer to the [Integrating Cloud Accounts](https://readme.facets.cloud/docs/integrating-cloud-accounts) documentation.
7. After completing the above steps, click the **Create** button to initiate the Blueprint creation process.
