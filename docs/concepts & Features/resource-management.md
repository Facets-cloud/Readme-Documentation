## [Secrets and Variables](doc:configuration-management-for-services)

Facets streamlines the management of secrets and variables, ensuring secure and flexible configurations through environment variables. Directly add variables to blueprints, utilize dynamic referencing for secrets, and access configurations from external resources, all within Facets' secure framework. This approach centralizes secret management, making it easier to manage sensitive information across different environments and services.

## [Guardrail Policies](doc:guardrail-policy)

Guardrail Policies in Facets provide a robust mechanism to enforce organizational standards and reduce errors as Blueprints scale in complexity. With policies written in Rego code, users can create rules that span across resources, ensuring alignment with best practices. Manage policies with ease, set granular enforcement criteria, and categorize policy severity to maintain compliance and operational integrity throughout your software stack.
