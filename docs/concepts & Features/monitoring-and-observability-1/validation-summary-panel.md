The Validations Summary Panel serves as a central hub for identifying potential errors and broken references. In addition, it also alerts users to instances where resources do not comply with Guardrail policies.

By providing immediate visibility, the panel helps you quickly pinpoint errors, avoid release failures, and boost developer productivity.

## Validation Cycle

The Validation Summary panel operates a validation cycle every 5 minutes, promptly capturing and displaying errors and potential issues.

## Types of Validations

The panel performs several types of validations to ensure the adherence of compliance in your resources:

* **Disabled Resource References:** Alerts you when a resource incorrectly references another resource that is disabled.
* **Invalid Reference Expression:** Highlights errors in reference expressions, such as when a service refers to a database using an incorrect path.
* **GuardRails Compliance Issues:** Notifies you of any violations against your defined guardrail policies.
* **Non-Existent Resource Reference:** Warns you when a resource references another resource that does not exist in the Blueprint.
* **JSON Syntax Error:** Detects and signals any JSON syntax errors in the resource configurations, helping you maintain correct syntax.

## Using Validations Summary Panel

1. Navigate to **Environment > Releases** and select the **Validations** tab.
2. If any validation errors are present in your resource definitions, you can find them on this page with details about the error and the location.
3. To initiate a reevaluation of these validation errors, click **Run Validation.**
