# Is Facets.cloud Right for Your Use Cases?

## Managing Multiple Environments as a Commodity

> SAAS, Scaled up Digital Natives

Facets.cloud enables handling multiple environments as standardized units that can be provisioned, managed, and terminated across clouds and regions on demand. This setup supports SaaS providers and geographically distributed operations needing rapid deployment for development, QA, staging, and production environments.

**Example:** A SaaS company deploys application environments across regions for client-specific setups. With Facets.cloud, they automate these deployments to maintain uniform configurations across locations.

## Managing Environments Across Multiple Cloud Providers

> SAAS, Scaled up Digital Natives, Enterprises

Facets.cloud provides a unified approach to environment management across AWS, Azure, GCP, and hybrid setups, enabling consistent provisioning, monitoring, and control across cloud providers.

**Example:** A SaaS company operates on AWS but needs to support Azure for a large enterprise client. Facets.cloud allows them to create and manage environments on Azure without altering their established configurations or workflows.

## Automating Cloud Deployments from Manual Operations

> SAAS, Scaled up Digital Natives, Enterprises, Startups

Facets.cloud enables end-to-end automation for infrastructure provisioning, reducing the need for manual configurations. This is valuable for organizations transitioning to a platform engineering model, where automation handles infrastructure needs and DevOps teams focus on higher-value work.

**Example:** A team previously configured resources manually for each application deployment. Facets.cloud allows them to automate these workflows, reducing setup time and configuration errors, and shifting focus to platform engineering practices.

## Standardizing Software Delivery Across Distributed Teams

> Enterprises

Facets.cloud ensures distributed teams follow uniform configurations, similar automations, and the same approach to cloud delivery. This setup supports repeatable workflows, reduces onboarding time, and minimizes deployment variation.

**Example:** A company with regional development teams uses Facets.cloud to enforce uniform configurations, automations, and cloud deployment practices across environments, supporting platform engineering principles and simplifying setup for new team members.

## Supporting Startups Looking to Delay DevOps Hiring

> Startups

Facets.cloud offers a suite of automation modules that enable startups to adopt out-of-the-box automation, deferring the need to scale DevOps teams. With Facets.cloud, startups achieve foundational automation and infrastructure setup without extensive DevOps resources.

**Example:** A startup deploying services on AWS uses Facets.cloudâ€™s automation modules for infrastructure setup, application deployment, and monitoring, deferring the need for dedicated DevOps hires.

## Migrating Between Cloud Providers

> SAAS, Scaled up Digital Natives, Enterprises, Startups

For organizations switching cloud providers due to business or regulatory requirements, Facets.cloud abstracts and replicates configurations across new environments, reducing the workload for DevOps teams managing cloud migrations and enabling a smoother transition.

**Example:** A company moves its infrastructure from AWS to GCP, making internally developed tools irrelevant and requiring significant effort to build expertise and automation on GCP. Facets.cloud automates configuration replication, reducing the migration burden.

## Environment as a Service for On-Demand Provisioning

> SAAS, Scaled up Digital Natives, Enterprises, Startups

Facets.cloud enables on-demand provisioning of environments for development, testing, and QA cycles, supporting rapid environment creation and teardown as project needs change.

**Example:** A team requires testing environments for each release cycle. Facets.cloud provisions these environments with predefined configurations, allowing quick setup and teardown.
