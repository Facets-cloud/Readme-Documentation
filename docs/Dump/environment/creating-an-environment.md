After creating your Project, you can now launch the first manifestation of it, which is the **Environment.**

## How to Create an Environment?

1. Open **Projects** and select the required Project.
2. Now, select the **Environments** tab and you will be greeted with a prompt to create your first Environment.
3. Mention the **Environment Name** and select the **Release Stream.**
4. Click **Create.**

You have successfully created a logical environment.

You can monitor the current status of all your created environments from the **Environments** tab within your project. For any newly created environment, the status will be displayed as **STOPPED** until it is launched.
