This guide provides a step-by-step process for deploying your application on Facets. Whether your application is containerized, non-containerized, or uses Helm charts, YAML with Argo CD, or Docker Compose, the following sections will help you map your existing setup to Facets.  

Let's go through the steps one by one :

1. **Deploying Your Application**: Migrate your application based on its current deployment method.  
2. **Bringing Dependencies**: Set up databases and cloud resources to ensure proper integration.  
3. **Exposing Your Application to the Internet**: Configure ingress and custom domains for external access.
