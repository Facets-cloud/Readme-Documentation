## The Day-to-Day Difference: Terraform Platforms vs. Facets

Infrastructure teams today have automated a lot — but they’re still stuck working at the wrong level of abstraction. If you’re managing Terraform with TFE, env0, or similar tools, chances are your current flow looks like this:

### A Clear Comparison: Traditional Terraform vs. Facets

| **Traditional Terraform Platforms**   | **With Facets.cloud**                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Teams author and debug HCL modules.   | Developer Teams define what they need — Facets handles the Terraform. |
| CI/CD pipelines set up per project.   | Built-in orchestration with auto-promotion.                           |
| Shared codebase = team collisions.    | Environments and modules are isolated by default.                     |
| Drift detection is layered or manual. | Drift is prevented by design.                                         |
| Reuse = copy-paste and tweak.         | Reuse via versioned, typed blueprints.                                |
| Developers must understand Terraform. | Developers choose high-level intents (e.g., web service).             |

### What Your Day Looks Like with Facets

* 📦 *Spin up a new environment — no Terraform edits needed.*
* 🚀 *Promote infra from staging to production with one command.*
* 🔐 *Stay compliant by default — guardrails and policies built in.*
* 👥 *Developers self-serve infra safely through a UI or API.*

***

### You Might Relate If…

* Your teams copy-paste Terraform modules across repos.
* Every environment has its own script, pipeline, and edge case.
* You’ve had production drift… and wished for better control.
* You built a “self-service” portal, but it still asks for Terraform inputs.
* You’re the infra lead — and you still get pinged for every new S3 bucket.

***

### What’s Different with Facets

* No Terraform knowledge required to provision infra.
* Safe-by-default blueprints replace copy-paste.
* Promotion workflows are declarative, not manual.
* Inputs are constrained, validated, and enforced up front.
* Developers declare *what* they need. Platform teams control *how* it's provisioned.

### Don't Just Automate Terraform. Abstract It.

You’re not just running infra. You’re building the foundation every other team relies on.\
With Facets, infrastructure scales like software — safe, reusable, and self-serve by design.
