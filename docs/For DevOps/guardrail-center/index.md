# Guardrail Center

## Introduction to Guardrails

Guardrails in Facets provide a powerful policy enforcement framework that helps your organization maintain consistent standards across cloud infrastructure deployments. They act as automated validators that examine your blueprints before deployment, ensuring they align with your organization's established standards.

As cloud infrastructure grows more complex, maintaining consistency becomes increasingly challenging. Guardrails address this challenge by codifying your organization's best practices and compliance requirements into automated policies that validate your blueprints against defined rules.

## What You Can Do in Guardrail Center

The Guardrail Center is your central hub for creating, managing, and monitoring policy enforcement across your Facets environment:

* **Create and manage policies** using pre-built templates or custom Rego code
* **Set enforcement levels** to either warn about or block non-compliant deployments
* **Target specific resources** with granular policy application
* **Monitor compliance** through comprehensive validation reporting
* **Maintain audit trails** with detailed policy enforcement logs

## Getting Started

New to guardrails? Start by exploring our pre-built policy templates that cover common compliance, security, and operational requirements. These templates make it easy to implement best practices without writing complex policy code.

For teams with specific requirements, you can create custom policies using Rego, a purpose-built policy language that provides powerful validation capabilities.
