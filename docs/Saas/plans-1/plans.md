Facets offers two distinct plans to cater to various organizational needs and preferences: the **SaaS Offering** and the **PaaS Offering.** Each plan is tailored to different levels of control, customization, and infrastructure complexity, providing flexibility to meet diverse requirements.

## SaaS Offering

* **Managed Service:** The SaaS plan is a fully managed service hosted by Facets. This means Facets manages the infrastructure, including maintenance, updates, and security.
* **Ease of Use:** Designed for simplicity, the SaaS offering is ideal for organizations starting out or those with straightforward infrastructure needs.
* **Standard Features:** Includes essential features necessary for effective DevOps management such as automated deployments, monitoring, and basic validation.
* **Scalability:** Easily scale resources and applications without complex configurations. The SaaS plan supports growth while keeping management efforts minimal.
* **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and Kubernetes, providing a unified experience for managing deployments across these platforms.
* **Support:** Access to Facets support team for assistance with troubleshooting and resolving issues. This support ensures a smooth experience and quick resolution of any challenges.
* **Best For:** Ideal for companies starting out with simpler infrastructure needs. The SaaS offering is well-suited for organizations looking for a hassle-free, managed service to get up and running quickly.

### Pricing

### Resource Instance Pricing

### Pricing Flexibility

The standard pricing is a starting point and may be adjusted based on the specific infrastructure and requirements of the company. The per-resource pricing can also be reviewed and modified based on actual usage and needs.

## PaaS Offering

* **Customer-Managed Infrastructure:** The PaaS plan enables organizations to run everything on their own infrastructure. Customers are responsible for managing the underlying hardware and software resources, providing full control over their environment.
* **Advanced Features:** Offers a comprehensive set of advanced features, including extensive configuration options and additional resources not available in the SaaS plan. This plan supports complex infrastructure setups and sophisticated requirements.
* **Customizability:** Highly customizable, allowing for tailored configurations to meet specific organizational needs. The PaaS offering is ideal for companies with complex infrastructure and unique requirements.
* **Comprehensive Control:** Provides full control over the environment, including resource allocation, scaling, and security settings. This level of control is beneficial for organizations with specific compliance or security requirements.
* **Blueprint Management:** Leverage advanced Blueprint features for defining and managing infrastructure configurations. The PaaS plan allows for deeper customization and management of Blueprints.
* **Enhanced Security:** Offers greater control over security policies and practices. Organizations can implement custom security measures and ensure adherence to internal standards.
* **Cost Management:** While the PaaS plan may involve higher upfront costs related to infrastructure management, it offers potential long-term savings through efficient resource utilization and tailored configurations.
* **Best For:** Suited for larger companies with more complex infrastructure needs. The PaaS offering is ideal for organizations requiring advanced features, extensive customization, and comprehensive control over their environment.

### Pricing

### Custom Pricing

The pricing for the PaaS offering is highly variable and depends on multiple factors, including:

* **Infrastructure Specifications:** The complexity and scale of the infrastructure being managed.
* **Support Contract:** The level and scope of support required.

### Contract-Based Determination

Pricing is determined on a case-by-case basis during the contract negotiation process. Detailed discussions will ensure that the pricing reflects the specific needs and scale of the infrastructure.

## Conclusion

In summary, the SaaS Offering is optimal for companies starting out or those with simpler infrastructure, providing a managed, easy-to-use solution. In contrast, the PaaS Offering caters to larger organizations with complex infrastructure requirements, offering advanced features and greater control for sophisticated setups. Each plan is designed to address different levels of complexity and control, allowing organizations to select the option that best aligns with their operational needs and strategic goals.

In both cases, Facets is committed to providing a pricing model that aligns with the unique requirements of each organization. For accurate pricing, potential customers are encouraged to engage in a discussion with the sales team to tailor the plan to their needs and ensure optimal value.
