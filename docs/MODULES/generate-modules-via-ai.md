## Facets' **Module-Generation MCP**

You can also build custom modules using our **Module Creation Platform (MCP)** â€” a powerful CLI tool designed to simplify and accelerate the process of writing Terraform modules for Facets.

Some key advantages of using this MCP:

* **Faster** module creation with guided prompts and validations
* **Standardised** structure that aligns with Facets' module registry
* **Supports custom logic**, templating, and metadata integration.
