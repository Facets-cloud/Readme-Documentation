Access management for resources is a critical function for any organization. Proper access management helps you formalize who has access to what resources, and what they can do with those resources.

Facets provides the capability to do this with Role-based access Control (RBAC). Find more information about the different roles and permissions in [Managing Users](https://readme.facets.cloud/docs/user-management#rbac).

## Restrict User Access to Environments from your Control Plane

1. Login to your **Control Plane**.
2. Click on the **Settings** icon in your sidebar. This will open the **User Management** screen by default.
3. Find the user you want to restrict access to and click on the **Edit User** icon under the **Actions** column.
