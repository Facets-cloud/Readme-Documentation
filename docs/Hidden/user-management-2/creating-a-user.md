### Multiple User Groups

* Multiple user groups can be assigned to a user.
* Project, environment, account and resource access is determined based on the combined access from all assigned user groups.
* Roles/Environment-Specific Roles: In case of conflict, role from the most recently assigned user group takes precedence.

Note: Only environments selected in accessible environments field would be available if multiple user groups are assigned.
