Resource Groups are a key feature for organizing and managing resources within the Facets platform, allowing for better control, collaboration, and access management.

* They provide a structured approach to organizing and managing resources. 
* They allow you to bundle related resources together, such as services, databases, and caches, simplifying resource management and aligning with your team and pod structures.

### Use Cases for Resource Groups

* **Team-Based Access Control**: Create Resource Groups for each team or department, granting access only to the resources they need.
* **Segmentation in Release**: Use this segmentation to release dependent resources together while performing selective release.
* **Project-Based Organization**: Group resources based on the Projects to manage them separately.
* **Perform Bulk Operations**: Filter out resources in the resource center based on resource groups to perform bulk operations like Enable and Disable.

### How to Manage Access to Resource Groups

* **Assigning User Groups**: Resource Groups can be assigned to user groups, ensuring that only users within those groups have access to the specified resources.
