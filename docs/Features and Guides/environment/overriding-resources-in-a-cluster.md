Facets provides the flexibility to directly modify any resource configurations in an environment from the Control Plane. This feature is particularly useful when there is a need to make modifications in the environment that will deviate from the Blueprint. Using overrides, you can make any specific changes needed as per your use case.

## How to Override Resources for an Environment?

1. Open the **Projects** tab and select your desired project.
2. Select the **Resource Center** tab and select the environment where the values need to be updated.
3. Select the desired resource and Click on **Overrides** tab
4. Update the desired values in the **Form** or **JSON** mode and click **Save Changes.**

**Note:** Any changes made to the overridden configuration will only take effect after the next release.

You have successfully overridden the Resource for an Environment.
