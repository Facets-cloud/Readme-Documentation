Below is the end-user documentation for the Environment Settings sections **other than Advanced**. This guide is intended to help you configure and manage your environment through an easy-to-understand interface. For information on Advanced settings, please refer to the separate Advanced Settings page.

***

# Environment Settings Overview

The Environment Settings section in Facets allows you to manage key aspects of your cloud environment. This includes setting basic details, managing time-sensitive operations, scheduling releases, configuring your infrastructure as code (IaC), setting up VPN access, and handling critical configurations in the Danger Zone.

Use the left-hand menu on the Environment Settings page to navigate between these sections:

* **General**
* **Time Sensitive**
* **Releases**
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
* **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**
* [Advanced](https://readme.facets.cloud/docs/advanced-settings-in-facets)
* **Danger Zone**

***

# General Settings

In the **General** section, you can update the basic details of your environment.

### Environment Details

* **Edit Environment Name:** Update the name of your environment.\
  **Note:** The environment name can only be changed if the environment has not yet been launched.
* **Release Stream:** Specify or update the release stream associated with this environment.

### Instance Type

* **Modify Instance Type:** Choose a different instance type or adjust cloud-specific settings.\
  **Note:** Changing the instance type while your environment is running will trigger a release to apply the update.

### Saving Changes

* **Save Changes Button:** After making modifications, click this button to save your settings.\
  **Tip:** If your environment is running, saving changes may trigger a release process.

***

# Time Sensitive Settings

The **Time Sensitive** section lets you manage the availability schedule of your environment.

### Availability Schedule

* **Configure Schedule:** Set up daily or weekly schedules by specifying start and stop times.\
  **Best Practice:** Ensure that the stop time is set later than the start time to avoid configuration errors.
* **Manage Updates:** Modify the schedule anytime to adjust the periods when your environment is available.

<br />

### Short-lived Environment Configuration

The **Short-lived Environment** section lets you configure automated teardown behavior for environments that are manually launched or scaled up. This is especially useful for managing **ephemeral workloads** such as testing, QA, or short-term experiments.

#### Configuration Options

* **Teardown Action**\*: Choose the action to execute automatically after a manual operation:
  * **Scale Down**: Reduce resource usage by scaling down the environment.
  * **Destroy**: Completely tear down the environment.

* **Trigger Delay**\*: Set the time delay before the teardown action executes. This can be defined in **hours**, **minutes**, or **seconds**.

#### Use Cases

* Prevent resource waste from forgotten environments
* Automate cleanup for ad-hoc or temporary environments
* Improve cost control and operational hygiene

#### How to Configure

1. Navigate to the **Time Sensitive Settings** in the environment settings panel.
2. Scroll to **Short-lived Environment**.
3. Select the **Teardown Action** (`Scale Down` or `Destroy`).
4. Set the **Trigger Delay**.
5. Click **Save Changes** to apply the configuration.

# Releases

The **Releases** section allows you to manage when updates and changes are applied to your environment.

### Release Schedule

* **Manage Releases:** Create, update, or delete release schedules according to your deployment needs.
* **Redirect for Status:** Changing the release schedule may redirect you to the Releases page where you can verify the status of your scheduled releases.

### Cluster Settings for Releases

* **Update Cluster Settings:** Configure settings that affect cluster releases.\
  **Note:** Changes here may also trigger a release if your environment is currently running.

### Navigation Tip

* **Quick Access:** Use the provided navigation links to jump directly to the Releases page and review the status of your releases.

***

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

The **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** section enables you to manage your environmentâ€™s infrastructure using code-based configurations.

### Terraform Version

* **Select Terraform Version:** Choose the appropriate Terraform version that is compatible with your setup.\
  **Note:** Ensure compatibility to avoid deployment issues.

### Maintenance Window

* **Configure Maintenance:** Define maintenance windows for updates and regular tasks.\
  **Best Practice:** Schedule maintenance during off-peak hours to minimize impact.

### Saving Changes

* **Save Changes Button:** Click to apply any changes made in the IaC section, which may trigger updates as needed.

***

# Virtual Private Network (VPN)

The **VPN** section lets you control VPN access for your environment.

### Enable/Disable VPN

* **Toggle VPN:** Turn the VPN server on or off based on your security needs.\
  **Important:** Changes here may trigger a selective release if your environment is running.

### Saving Changes

* **Save Changes Button:** After adjusting the VPN settings, save your changes to apply them.

***

# Danger Zone

The **Danger Zone** is where you can access critical settings that have a significant impact on your environment. These settings should be used with caution.

### Critical Settings

* **Access with Caution:** Changes in the Danger Zone can alter key operational aspects of your environment.\
  **Recommendation:** Only modify these settings if you fully understand the impact, or if you have been advised by Facets support.

***

# Notifications and Error Handling

* **Success Messages:** When changes are saved successfully, you will receive a confirmation message.
* **Error Messages:** If there is an issue, detailed error messages will appear to help you resolve any problems.

***

# Best Practices

* **Review Before Saving:** Always double-check your changes before saving, especially if your environment is live.
* **Test in Staging:** Consider testing significant changes in a staging environment before applying them to production.
* **Monitor Releases:** After changes that trigger a release, monitor your release dashboard to ensure that updates are applied correctly.
* **Documentation:** Keep a log of the changes you make. This is particularly useful for troubleshooting or rolling back to previous settings if needed.
