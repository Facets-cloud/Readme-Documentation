## Best Practices

To ensure a smooth and efficient release process, follow these best practices:

* **Use Plan Releases Before Applying Changes:** Always review proposed changes to detect unintended modifications and potential misconfigurations.
* **Limit Selective Releases to Critical Fixes:** Excessive selective changes can cause configuration drift, leading to inconsistencies over time.
* **Automate Full Releases for Stability:** Schedule regular full releases to maintain infrastructure consistency and prevent untracked changes.
* **Backup Before Destroy Release:** Always take snapshots or backups before deprovisioning an environment to avoid data loss.
* **Test Custom Releases in a Staging Environment:** Execute custom commands in a non-production environment first to validate their impact.
* **Implement Access Controls:** Define and enforce permissions based on user roles to prevent unauthorized or accidental modifications.
* **Setup necessary notification:** Setup necessary notifications using the deployment status update subscription to be informed about all the releases.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Release Stuck or Taking Too Long:** Check the logs for execution status and potential errors. Verify network connectivity and API response times. Ensure that Terraform state is not locked due to another ongoing release.
2. **Failed Release Execution:** Inspect error messages for root causes, such as missing variables or incorrect configurations. Ensure IAM permissions are correctly set for the executing user. Validate that the target environment is accessible and not in a restricted state.
3. **Selective Release Not Applying Changes:** Verify that the correct resources are targeted in the configuration. Check for dependency conflicts preventing the changes from being applied.
4. **Plan Release Showing Unexpected Changes:** Ensure that the Terraform state is correctly synchronized with the actual infrastructure. Review previous deployments to identify any untracked modifications.
5. **Destroy Release Failing to Remove Resources:** Check for dependencies preventing deletion, such as manually created resources. Verify that Terraform has the correct permissions to deprovision all resources.
6. **Launch Release Not Creating Expected Resources:** Confirm that all required configurations and templates are correctly defined. Validate the cloud providerâ€™s service limits and quotas.
