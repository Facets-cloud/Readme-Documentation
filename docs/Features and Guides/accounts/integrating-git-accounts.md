# Why Link your Git Accounts?

Facets enables GitOps workflows by connecting your Git accounts. This allows you to:

- Manage infrastructure configurations directly from your Git repositories
- Track infrastructure changes through Git history
- Enable two-way sync between your Git accounts and Facets

## How To Link Your Github Account

Connect your Github account by installing the Facets Github App, providing secure access to your repositories.

### Steps to Link:

1. Navigate to **Settings -> Accounts** in Facets
2. Click on the ** Github** icon.
3. Provide a **Unique Name** for the integration, this is only used on Facets.
4. Click on **Link** to start the GitHub App installation
5. Select your **Organization** and **Repositories** you'd like to give access to through GitHub's interface.
   - **Important Note**: You do not need to give us access to your code repositories, and do not need to select "All repositories".
   - You can select any existing Facets blueprint repositories if you have them and want them imported into Facets.
   - Otherwise, select any random repository (GitHub does not allow selecting zero repositories, unfortunately).
   - After this setup, any project created from Facets will also have a repository created with it. That repository will automatically be added to the app installation.
6. You have now successfully linked your GitHub account!
