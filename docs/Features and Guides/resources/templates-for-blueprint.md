Templates in Facets are reusable groups of pre-configured resources that can be added to a blueprint with a single action. Rather than manually adding and configuring each resource individually, users can streamline their workflow by incorporating templates that encapsulate a logical set of components.

Templates enable consistency, reduce human error, and accelerate blueprint creationâ€”especially when commonly used patterns or modules are involved (e.g., service + database + monitoring stack).

## Types of Templates

Facets supports two types of templates:

**Facets-Provided Templates**: These are built-in templates offered by Facets for common infrastructure setups. They represent best practices and standard configurations, ready to be reused.

**Custom Templates**: These are user-defined templates that can be created from existing blueprints and reused across different projects. They help teams standardize infrastructure patterns across environments and organisations.

### How to Use an Existing Template

* Templates can be found in the right pane under **Templates Tab**. Facets provided templates are listed under "Capabilities" and Custom templates are listed under "Custom" category.
* To add a template, user needs to select the template to be added and provide a prefix. This prefix will be automatically appended to all the resource names inside the template to avoid naming conflicts

***Note:** Users can add the same template multiple times to a blueprint by using different prefixes each time.*

### How to Create a Template

* Facets allows users to save the current blueprint as a template with a **"Save as Template"** option.
* Enter name of the template, description and the account in which the template should be saved (the github repo of that blueprint will be created in the selected account).

## Advantages of Using Templates

* **Time-Saving:** Add multiple related resources in one go instead of configuring them individually.
* **Standardization:** Maintain consistency in resource configurations across environments and teams.
* **Reusability**: Reduce duplication of effort by reusing pre-tested infrastructure setups.
* **Version Control:** Templates are managed in Git, enabling collaborative updates and rollback if needed.
* **Error Reduction:** Minimize manual configuration errors by using predefined and tested resource combinations.
