Resource Groups are a key feature for organizing and managing resources within the Facets platform, allowing for better control, collaboration, and access management.

- They provide a structured approach to organizing and managing resources. 
- They allow you to bundle related resources together, such as services, databases, and caches, simplifying resource management and aligning with your team and pod structures.

### Use Cases for Resource Groups

- **Team-Based Access Control**: Create Resource Groups for each team or department, granting access only to the resources they need.
- **Segmentation in Release**: Use this segmentation to release dependent resources together while performing selective release.
- **Project-Based Organization**: Group resources based on the Projects to manage them separately.
- **Perform Bulk Operations**: Filter out resources in the resource center based on resource groups to perform bulk operations like Enable and Disable.
