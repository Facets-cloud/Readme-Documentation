The **Release History** tab maintains a chronological record of all changes made to a resource within a specific environment. It provides detailed insights into how your resource has evolved over time, tracking everything from configuration changes to deployment updates.

## Use Cases

The Release History tab is particularly useful for:

* **Viewing Release Details**: Understand what changes were made, who made them, and when they were applied.
* **Analyzing Changes**: Identify differences in configurations, deployments, and updates to investigate potential issues.
* **Tracking Deployments**: Gain visibility into deployments across environments to ensure stability and consistency.

## Functionality

The **Release History** tab includes the following key features:

### 1. **Change Types**

1. **BLUEPRINT**: Changes to the base configuration in your blueprint.
2. **OVERRIDE**: Environment-specific configuration changes.
3. **ARTIFACT**: Updates to deployed images or artifacts.

### 2) **Action Buttons**

* **View Release Details**: Navigate to the release details page.
* **View Terraform Logs**: Check the complete terraform logs for quick reference.
* **Resource Rollback**: Resource Rollback lets you instantly switch a resource (artifact, blueprint, and override) back to a previously deployed version. It is a non-destructive, quick recovery tool used to stabilize a system after a bad deployment without reverting ongoing changes or deleting anything.
