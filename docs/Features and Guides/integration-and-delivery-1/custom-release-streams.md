## How to Add Custom Release Streams?

Facets allows users to add multiple custom release streams alongside predefined ones provided out of the box.

> ðŸ“˜
>
> **Note:** While all users can view the list of release streams, creating and deleting release streams requires the `RELEASE_STREAM_WRITE` and `RELEASE_STREAM_DELETE` permissions, respectively.

1. Open **Settings** and select the **Release Streams** tab.\
   Here, you will be able to view a list of release streams available in Facets.
2. Click **Create Release Stream.**
3. In the pop-up that appears:
   1. Mention the **Release Stream Name** and **Description.**
   2. Now, enable the toggle to set this as a **Production Release Stream.**

> ðŸ“˜
>
> **Note:** Enabling **Production Release Stream** allows you to halt all scheduled releases using the Facets bot in the event of an issue.

5. Click **Create.**
