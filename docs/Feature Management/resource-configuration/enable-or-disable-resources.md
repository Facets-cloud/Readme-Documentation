Facets provide a way to dynamically manage system functionality that allows for better control and efficiency.

**Note:** Facets recommends disabling all the resources at the Blueprint level. You can enable the resources only in the specific environments where they are needed, optimizing resource usage and cost efficiency.

## How to Enable or Disable Resources Individually?

1. Select the desired Blueprint from **Blueprints** and select the environment from the **Environment** tab.
2. Now, select the **Resource Center** tab. 
3. Open the **Resource Details** page by selecting the resource.
4. Click **Enable**/**Disable** from the top right corner. 
5. In the popup that appears,  type the **Resource Name** in the text box and click **Enable**/**Disable.**

## How to Enable or Disable Resources in Bulk?

Particularly when dealing with a large number of resources, enabling or disabling them individually can be time-consuming and inefficient. The ability to enable or disable resources in bulk streamlines this process. The following steps will guide you on how to achieve this:

1. Select the desired Blueprint from **Blueprints** and select the environment from the **Environment** tab.
2. Now, select the **Resource Center** tab.
3. Select the resources you wish to enable or disable and click the **Enable**/**Disable** button at the bottom.
4. In the pop-up that appears, type **Confirm** and click **Enable**/**Disable.**

**Note:** The bulk enable or disable feature allows for mass enabling or disabling of resources; however, it's important to remember that only one action type can be selected at a time - either enabling disabled resources or disabling enabled ones. Random selection of resources for mixed actions is not supported.
