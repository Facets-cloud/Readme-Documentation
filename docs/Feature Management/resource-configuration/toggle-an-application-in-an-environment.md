The primary use case for selectively enabling or disabling an application in an environment is to either add or remove that particular application in the next release. This is achieved by overriding the Container Configuration for an application from its Configuration Screen.

## Prerequisites

An application should be defined in the blueprint specification in the environment where you want to override its current configuration.

## Disable an Application from your Control Plane

1. Login to Facets Control Plane. 
2. Select the **Blueprint** which has your **Environment**.
