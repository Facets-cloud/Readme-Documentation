Once your module is fully implemented and tested locally, it can be published to Facets so others can discover and reuse it. Use the [detailed guide](https://github.com/Facets-cloud/module-development-cli) to know how the module can be published using Facets CLI.

### Versioning Strategy

Facets modules use a versioned structure similar to APIs. You can continue updating a version (like `1.0`) as long as all changes are **backward compatible**. If you make **breaking changes**â€”such as removing inputs or changing the shape of existing onesâ€”publish a **new version folder** (e.g., `2.0`).

> ðŸ§  Think of versioning in Facets like API versioning:
> 
> As long as your inputs and behavior are backward compatible, you can keep publishing to the same version.

### Readiness Checklist

Before you publish, ensure your module is clean, validated, and ready to use.

**âœ… Module Publishing Checklist**

- [ ] All inputs are defined in `variables.tf` with clear descriptions and types.  
- [ ] The `spec` section in `variables.tf` is a valid **JSON Schema**, enabling Facets to generate forms automatically.  
- [ ] Terraform logic in `main.tf` relies only on:
  - `var.inputs.<field>` for user-supplied values
  - `var.instance_name` and `var.environment.unique_name` for naming
- [ ] The module contains **no provider blocks**, **no outputs**, and uses only defined variables.  
- [ ] Youâ€™ve tested the module using the CLI `ftf validate` command.  
- [ ] Youâ€™ve bumped the version folder if breaking changes were made.  

> ðŸ’¡ Pro tip: Use Git branches or tags to manage multiple versions during development.

### Module Versioning and Adoption

Each module version is immutable once published. When a new version is created under the same Intent and Flavor, users can choose to adopt it at their own pace. Projects using older versions wonâ€™t be auto-upgraded. This ensures:

- Stability â€“ Active environments aren't affected by upstream changes.
- Control â€“ Teams can evaluate changes before rolling them out.

To adopt a new version, navigate to the project using the module, select the new version from dropdown and save & apply the changes to update the environment.

### CI for Modules

All modules should be tested via CI before publishing. Your CI pipeline should run `ftf validate` and ensure the module adheres to Facetsâ€™ requirementsâ€”particularly around schema, naming, and file structure. This keeps the published module stable and discoverable.

Next up, we will learn how to set up a CI pipeline for inner-sourced modules to automate testing and publishing before theyâ€™re used across teams.
